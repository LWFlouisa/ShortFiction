	Jonah had no other friends besides a teddy bear and an eggplant.
	"Jonah, I'm sorry to tell you this," Ezekiel said, puffing on his cigarette letting the mist rise slowly into the air. "Your just not a fit for us."
	Despite not being to surprised, Jonah was still hurt by this and many of the other things that who he once looked up to said during that particular evening. He did not really care whether he ever talked to him ever again. He exited the pool palace, crossed the roads not caring whether a car would hit him, and when he entered the university didn't pay attention to the door hitting him in the face. He jerked about as if he were injured, and opened the dorm. A room where he felt the most comfort. Where he could be away from the world.
	The lights buzzed in and out.
	The bathroom was in complete disrepair; the toilet had a red stain, the bath tub also had layers of brown rust. Due to his lack of cleaning it often, it built up a very thin layer of dust. Jonah walked into the dimly lit room, and stared in the mirror. "I really need to clean this mirror." Not feeling like doing it, he went abruptly sat on the bed in order to reflect on his thoughts. Many times he tried to talk to Ezekiel, though it was only today in particular that the guy payed any attention to him at all.
	Teddy walked into the direction of the light.
	"Jonah, you should try to create your own group." he heard a voice say.
	Jonah didn't remember whether he open up the stuffed animal chest, in order to put in a radio to make him talk. Or if possibly the bear suddenly obtained the magical power to be able to talk on it's own. "Wouldn't that be great?" Jonah thought it was amusing that the bear sounded just like his favorite horror movie villain, a robot named Jab, who he a large power trip for a hand that drilled into people's skulls. He reclined in his bed in order to sleep.
	His laugh was mixed with a weep.
	"I want to form my own philosophy, something unique to me; it would center around assimilation, acceptance, and independent association; no more silence, only the music in my head." Jonah didn't remember the retort the Teddy made, maybe in fact the bear did not retort at all. Perhaps he was simply seeing things because of distress of the night. He gradually found the call of the dark night, gradually becoming harder to resist. He chose not to fight, he gave into the sleep.
	"I can help you Jonah, we can form our own group." said Jonah.

	When he woke up, it was twelve. Teddy had punched him in the face, and his jaw hurt. Staring around the room, he had the same old reminder of many paper. They were tossed across the floor. He felt that staying up, while laying in bed was a bore. Thus he got up and sat on his bed, and placed his hands over his face to drown away the tiredness. Teddy was resting again on his bed he specifically made from a weave, then looked at the ceiling tugging at his sleeve. "The music in my head."
	"So your up, we need to talk about you bashing my head against the wall." Teddy said. Eggplant was still asleep in his room. Jonah was to caught up in his own thoughts to be able to care about what the stuffed animal was saying, and went into the kitchen to make himself breakfast.
	"I did what now?" Jonah said half-listening.

	It was later in the morning, but still early. Jonah had his stuff ready in order to go to his class. "Wait for me Jonah, remember. I'm your friend." Jonah simply leaned his back backward, and laughed.
	"Your just a Teddy Bear." Jonah said, then left.
	Teddy was lonely in the dorm room, Eggplant was still sleeping. So he hopped onto the desk, carefully making sure that he did not knock anything onto the floor. Then he pounced on the Eggplant, and punched it in the face. "Hey wake up, it's Teddy." The eggplant growled because of his interrupted sleep, then in a mocking laugh pushed the Teddy off of him.
	"What are you wanting. Your just a Teddy." The words Teddy continued to repeat over and over again in the Teddy Bear's mind. "You know, I wonder if Jonah is going to try to talk with that one guy he keeps talking about again." Teddy was to caught up in his own thought to pay attention. The Eggplant got up, and punched the Teddy Bear in the face. "Hey I'm -" Eggplant couldn't finish.
"Don't touch me." Teddy said.

	Later that evening, Jonah finishes homework from class. "So Jonah, Mr. Jonah. How are you expecting to be able to run your life?" said Teddy.
	"Yea I'll just have you be Mr. Vice President." Jonah walked over to the door, then placed his ear upon it. "Hey I can hear voices. They sound like, are Ezekiel and his friends making fun of me outside?" Teddy bear walked over and stood behind him.
	"Why do you think that Jonah?" Teddy noted that Jonah was not particularly listening to him at the moment. :Alright let's get things straight. I'm going to be the one that takes the lead. You will follow me" But Jonah was to caught up listening, beyond the door. "Are you listening man, I'm Teddy your friend." The voices on the other end of the door stopped.
	"Hey Jonah, you OK Man. Something wrong?" Jonah heard Ezekiel's voice.
	"What it to you man?" said Teddy.
	"Shut up Teddy, they'll hear us." said Jonah.
	"I'll see you in class Jonah."

	Teddy, Eggplant, and Jonah all hung out and told ghost stories with each other. Then Jonah decided to get up, and go play pool. "Where you going Jonah, don't leave me!" said Teddy." Jonah simply puffed his hair on his face. Then cracked the door. "Hey Jonah, what's that empty CPU over there?" Jonah turned around, and stared at Teddy."
	"It's not what you think it is." Jonah said.
	"I can make the headmaster think it is." Teddy said.
	"And who would believe a -"
	"He'll think it's you talking."
	Because of this, he picked up both the Eggplant and the Teddy and brought them with him to be able to go and play pool. There the Goth girls stared at him, because he was talking to a stuffed eggplant and a Teddy Bear. They giggled to each other, then went into the bar. "Tough crowd tonight." said Teddy. Eggplant guy simply rolled his eyes.
	"It's not you, it's Jonah." said Eggplant.
	"Shut up, will you."
	"Hey Jonah, how are you talking to?" Ezekiel at the pool table asked?"
	"Ezekiel, Eggplant and Teddy. Eggplant and Teddy, Ezekiel." said Jonah.
	"Hey is he that guy you talk about a lot?" said Eggplant.
	"Shut up Eggplant." said Jonah.
	“Who talked about who?" said Ezekiel. At that point Ezekiel thought that something was seriously wrong with Jonah. "Hey, let's just play some pool OK."
	"Why did you have to say anything?" said Jonah to Eggplant.
	"Could not help it." said Eggplant.
	"Stop talking to yourself Jonah." said Ezekiel.
	"Oh I'm no." said Jonah.
	"Sure." said Ezekiel."

	They exited the pool house.
	"So Jonah, is everything OK?" said Ezekiel. They were going back to their dorm rooms. Ezekiel shut up his lady friends, that made sarcastic comments about liking his Eggplant.
	Jonah resisted cackling. "Yea everything is fine, why?" Then stared at him as he paused, “Why are you suddenly asking about me now?”
	"Your talking to a fucking Eggplant." said Ezekiel.
	"Don't you have imaginary friends Ezekiel?" Jonah said, then slammed his dorm room shut.
	Ezekiel stared at the door, that said do not disturb. "Sometime in the universe, you really will find stranger people than those like us."
	"Hey Ezekiel, let's go." said Jan.
	"Right." said Ezekiel.
