          I testify under oath, conspiracy to commit marketing evasion. But there was another conspiracy, closer to my heart.
          Even today there are times when I wish I could have one more chance to speak to my wife again, but as things turned out what felt like a dream took this chance away from me. Here is how I remember the event that led up to this. I was walking into my office, and it was like a barely cleaned surgeons table. Like a hospital barely cleaned by a dwindling staff. My coffin, I would sometimes joke.
          Here is how I remember the event that led up to this.
          I was sitting down in my meditation chair, placing on my gas mask sipping through the can-tine, my vision faded to black --- I fell through a wormhole, fading in switching colors --- I warped into the grocery store, and walked by specimen Joe boy in an invisible ghost form through the isle.
          I took a mental note of things the specimen was purchasing: A small range between organic non vat-grown ground beef, and bacon you could take out of the box, and eat it like that --- I flew from the parking lot to the inside of the specimen's car sitting in his front passenger seat. The trip is fading out in switching colors.
          I stared out of the window feeling the wind pass by his face, when I sat in the passenger seat of the specimen’s car. I was somewhat terrified, after all even if you have been trained for a few years like me, you still sometimes worry if you might mess up the in-tel gathering. The specimen was a friendly looking man with a bowl cut wearing a red tee, who turned to the side to look at me. He was ready to speak to me, and I was paralyzed wondering what he might say to the stranger in the car.
          “What do you want to listen to, what do you like?” the specimen said.
          “Just whatever man.” I said.
          The specimen used his right hand he used for smoking, and turned on the radio to a country music station --- I lost the dream-connection. I was disoriented while sitting on his meditation chair. Mr. Shalone was staring at me    through the tele-screen above his desk in the office. With his cold eyes, Shalone smiles artificially.
          “I’d like some in-tel on your research.” Mr. Shalone said.
          My boss’s office was a bit messier than mine, but there is was enough of a walkway to be able to properly walk into the room. Shelves are lined with many thick binders, most likely business documents. Mr. Shalone is smoking his cigar, while looking out into the window of the night. Into the darkness, not lit by the L.E.D light.
          “Batty, come in. Good evening.” Mr. Shalone said.
          My boss turned his chair around slowly, while puffing on his cigar looking at Batty in his feeble attempt and a business like stare. “What were the results?”
          “According to the Morse code, it says that our specimen likes to purchase ground beef of the non vat grown variety.” I said. Then looked closer at my notes. “And then when he goes home from the grocery store, listening to country music on the way home.”
          My boss fidgeted with his expensive cigar around in his mouth, exposing his large yellow teeth puffing smoke into the air. “Interesting, he must ... be a spend thrift. “That stuff does not come cheap these days.”
          I went to go get some water, before hitting the sack when I got home. He is pouring himself a glass, then walks down the stairs. He places it on the coffee table beside the bed. Looking at Sheila while she sleeps, I noticed she was choking very loudly. I knew at the time she had developed breathing problems over the last week. And I did not know she had an addiction at the time.
          I took a drink from his water glass, and carefully places it down onto the table so as not to spill it. He hopes he did not wake up Sheila. Under the covers, I connected to my own dreams. I had has his own unique advertisements he would experience that are transmitted in dream-space.My dream-switched, and he found himself unintentionally connecting to Sheila’s dreams.
          I covered my ears because the sound of the loud foot-steps on the shopping mall floor. Slowly it quieted down.
          Taking a look at his surroundings, I noticed there was an inactive restaurant. Still open, but might as well not have been. The light on the sign were well-worn from lack of maintenance, buzzing in and out.
          After seeing Sheila chat with the owner of the restaurant, I walked up to the door, and looked inside through it's glass.
          “I'll have about a pound.” Sheila said.
          “Wow, you sure you can --” the owner said.
          “Yes, I have the money ... wait, do you take credit?”
          “I will tell you what,” the owner said. Then looked at his watch. “if you can work for me we can work something out."
          I called into the door through the glass. “Hey Sheila!”
          I tried to open the door --- I abruptly got tossed out of Sheila's dream through a yet another connection loss, fading out switching colors.
          “Hey, Chris. It's weird...” She said. Sheila yawns meekly, quickly resettling herself under the covers, then moving to the side.
          “I thought I heard your voice.”
          “Yea, ... weird.”
          Sheila quickly went back to sleep, and started coughing again. It worried me that she choked as she slept. I quickly tried to get any last bit of sleep I could get before the morning sun.
          The next morning I climbed out of bed. I tended to get up later than Sheila. Maybe it was her passive-aggressive way of telling me, "fuck you!" We have not been very closely over the past week. I walked to their shelf by the bed, and opens the door. To his surprise, he finds white powder.
          For a moment everything became clear, then I decided not to testify against her. Because ... I ... knew in order to jack into dream-space I had my own cocktail I used to make a dream-connection.
          I was in Mr. Shalone’s office.
          “Mr. Batty, we want you to collect information about your wife --”
          “You want me to spy on Sheila?”
          “We are ensuring profits. The company comes first.” Mr Shalone said. He took a puff from his cigarette. “Remember that.” Then he puffed, smoked, and hacked exposing his yellow teeth. “Now get on it.”
          I sat on my meditation chair in my office. I tried to make a dream connection. The wormhole would not form. No connection. I tried one more time to make a connection.
          I was standing directly by Sheila. She switched to looking at Batty directly while performing the transaction.
          “Hey Sheila, what are you doing?” Sheila said.
          “Do you know this man, ma'am?” the owner said.
          “No.”
          Sheila walked out of the door, swiftly walking. She walked to go sit on the bench outside the restaurant. Batty walks over to talk to her while she comfortably sat. He appears like a ghost, although at that moment Sheila can see him when he walked up.
          “Chris, what the hell are you doing here?” Sheila said.
          “There is no time to explain.”
          “Sheila, I need to--” I lost the dream-connection.
          My gas mask was forcefully pulled from his face by Mr. Shalone. Batty jumps up suddenly, wondering what was going on.
          “What the hell do you think your doing! Chris! What the hell!” Mr. Shalone said. He was coughing and hacking, but not smoking his cigar. “Have you lost your fucking mind? Chris! I'm going to have to have you supervised.”
          At my apartment, in the kitchen.
          “Chris, what the are you doing?”
          “There is no time to explain, we need to go.
          The sky was a pinkish yellowish red, glowing. The city was a landfill of it's own making, trash compactors shoveling it's contents into large containers. The smoke from burning the contents filled the air.
          Sheila was sleeping in the car. Their Luggage fills the back seat. They are riding through the city to the tune of a soft classical melody played on the radio. She peeked her eyes open. “Where are we going, Chris?”
          “I don't know sweetheart.”
          “Just because I agreed to go with you, don't call me that."
          “Fine.”
          We were stopped at a red light.
          I looked in the traffic behind us. There was a black van with men in tuxedo's staring at them through their front view window. Batty can see their lips moving, they are chatting. As soon as the green light colored a go, I whizzed through the lanes. Police were chasing after both mine and the corporate hit men's cars, scaring Sheila.
          The two men in the black van, popped the tires of the police cars to keep them from chasing them.
          Sheila was panting and choking, as we quickly ran through the stairs away from the corporate hit men. She could hardly walk properly, shuffling. I was carrying both of their luggage.
          Then as if it were a bad nightmare, as they walked through the stairs, the men in the black van started running for him room at the bottom of the stairs. Having almost gotten to their room, one of the men aimed his sniper rifle at Batty.
          Sheila never gets the chance to reach the door.
          Before she turned around to check on me.
          Blinding flash of light.
          My cheek was scratched, then it hit Sheila in the back of her head.
          For a moment Batty I was in shock, paralyzed. I kneeled to check for Sheila’s pulse, hiding my face in her chest shaking. The police cars parked quickly surrounded the hotel building. The hit men gave up quickly.
          The cops shoved them into the cars, and I also came down the stairs. With his on his head, crouching with fear and wonderment.
          I am sitting in the police interrogation room barely lit by the L.E.D lighting the scar on my face. There are two cops in the room with me.
          “How is it your company managed to evade us for so long?" The interrogator says. Puffed on his pipe.
          “I don't know the origins of the program specifically.” I said. Then I paused abruptly as if to take a breath. “I know mainly my own part in it.”
          “And what was this?”
          “I mainly know what dream-space is, and why it was developed.”
          “Any amount of information you can give us will suffice.”
          “They call it dream-space, though that is not technically correct.” I paused again. Took a heave. “It was developed when my company among others wanted to evade ethical advertisement laws."
          “Why did they want to do that, when they earned so much--”
          “Power probably. They wanted to find a way to make even more money, and not have to worry about privacy laws.”
          “Batty paused abruptly to take a breath.”
          “Take your time, there is no rush on this.”
          “And so they found a group of scientist to produce a drug that would make you sleep, and make you hallucinate.”
          “This will be all for tonight, we will take again next afternoon.”
          “We are going to place you in protective custody so your company won't retaliate.”
          As I am led away under the supervision of a guard, who is cautiously escorting me out of the room dimly lit by the L.E.D light, I heard the other cops speak behind me.
          “He has been strangely cooperative, don't you think?”
          “What other choice does he have?" Foot-steps indicating a walk in the opposite direction by them. “His life is pretty much over.”
