### Anti-Features On The Net

-- They call them anti-features.

-- A nifty slogan.

-- It wasn’t a term I made up.

-- Then how did you think of it?

-- It was a yarn Richard Stallman spun.

She had been involved in the free software community for some time, until very recently when she got back into doing comics. She almost completely lost interest in doing Artificial Intelligence, do to the way some companies pretended to be fully transparent, while in practice encouraging the exact opposite of transparency. In this case, they preached complete and total transparency of the artificial intelligence industry. It was impossible to have a real conversation about Artificial Intelligence development in the community, and do she had largely left this space.

But recently she had met someone who wanted her to learn how to develop on the blockchain, there own specific variety. She had never developed on the blockchain before, and somewhat feared whether she might accidentally programm anti-features that would crash the performance of it. But the people that brought her own in the Telegram channel seemed sincere, despite them being the same people that would get onto her about being off topic in the community section. It was interesting that a lot of these people were equally unsatisfied with the situation, and that they themselves felt the pinch of not being able to have technical discussions.

When she had tried out the interface on the Ethereum network using metamask, she already found a major anti-feature that caused the website to come to a screeching halt. Sometimes it would take the entire evening, even past dinner time, for the computer to completely unfreeze. And yet there was suppose to be the shopping network where she would get Artificial Intelligence software packages, rather than simply make some for herself on different Gitea instances.

She had originally wanted to be an AI developer, and would dream about Robots battling other robots in underground caves, often shaped like giant bear dogs, that made a difference who won during the war between Japan and France in the American territories. She would see a first person perspective of a war dog robot, as it fired lasers from its mouth. There would have been a feature where the AI would target specific enemies, and the entire navigation system would be based around an Active Time Turn Based structure that made traveling the roguelike world based on a time meter, generally based on the amount of Agility each character had, and done across the whole navigation, rather than as part of the battle system.

But ultimately she decided to pursue the path of Artificial Intelligence, as this had a more direct path to helping her with her writing career, and helping her eventually develop a satisfactorally sentient ChatBot that SingularityNet might have defined as not being General, but they tended to use the word General incorrectly anyway.

Although her future as a developer was uncertain, at least she knew others experienced issues in that channel.

For her this was enough.

### Circular Theater Of Virtual Reality

The theater was closer to a three dimensional space exploration of the cosmos. Rather than a traditional production, it was placed on a circular platform, with the bleachers circling around its rim. The audience, mostly university students, spend their off hours watching science fiction and fantasy from different angles, with the new theater having characters that are fully rotational within the context of the play.

Sketching, in this context, has moved toward using virtual reality sketch in all three dimensions, leading to artists having to think in a slightly different way than sketching on paper. Although there is still a subset of artists that still use paper and ink. Rather than eliminating print, it has come to exist side by side with this new medium. In the audience, someone disillussioned by anarcho-communism, notices something strange about one of the drawn characters the actor was voicing, with them spazzing out in glitch mode, similar to a character in a three dimensional video game. Eventually the character collapsed, which seemed to go off script for the play.

– I’m very sorry people, we will have to postpone the rest of the play. Said one of the announcers.

It seemed like every play the ex-com visiting, it was always like this. It different matter what show they went to, there would be an actor that would spaz out, and having to take a space flight back to Earth just to get medical care to continue the show. Those who attended would be given the next half of the show free of cost, with them offered cryogenic hotel reservations to continue the show the next day.

– Her Ada, do you always have to ask that?

– Ask what?

– You always check on the actress.

– And do nothing?

– Just assume things will be fine.

She remembered back when she had lived with an ex room mate, participating in other activist circles, and it had effected to some degree her ability to trust people that engage in social activism, yet it seemed apparent that despite all their talk, not a single one of them would actually check on an actor or actress in a live audience production. They never cared if someone had a mental breakdown at the edge of space. The activists would probably still treat space flight as if it were a privilege, despite the fact that it had become almost mainstream over the last decade.

The cryogenic chamber, she lets her mind escape all previous thought of the event, if only to keep her own sanity. For at the end of the day, checking to see if an actor or actress was OK was all she could do.

But activists held up their hands to it.

– Your space flight is privilege.

###

-- So Korean is basically Japanese rotated 13 shifts?

-- Of course not, why would you think that?

-- Well I got that a Free Software Developer.

-- Likely source.

Japan and Korea had been bitter enemies since world war II, although why this rivalry lasted to the immigration to America, this was not entirely clear. Sometimes you would find Japanese-Americans and Korean-Americans that still held that old sense of rivalry, despite near generation of millenials even knowing what the inside of a prison looks like, and not experiencing racism to the same degree other minorities did, unless of course you asked a leftist, in which exclusively the middle class white man was the one that experienced no descrimination and victimization.

In this way, both TERFs and the Far Left merged in this deceptively unlikely way. The Far Left and Far Right also merged in terms of the way they expected their adherents to take their idealogy as if it were gospel. This was why the person that originally asked if Korean and Japanese had some mutual intelligibily, wondered what the real reason was she was called racist for even asking. It used to be you could ask whether Portuguese food was similar to Spanish food, and other things, and the only people that would get upset were first generation immigrants. This is why the programmer developed the theory that instead of genuine descrimination, the majority of Japanese-Americans and Korean-Americans, were simply being told to feel victimized by the far-left. This was why it was initially strange to her to find ones that believed in classical liberalism.

But given, in the past, people’s tendency to vote against their own interests, this probably should have been much less of a surprise than it was. This was why it was incrediply hard to move toward the enlightened center, despite holding onto much of her far left wing values, like worker-coops, and so forth. She wanted to become a small business owner, but found that it was impossible to keep her professional and personal life seperate on certain platforms, because Leftists kept harassing her online, with them not viewing a distinction. You would have leftists interogating her about her loyalty to worker-cooperatives, and other stuff, while still trying to build an author brand. It eventually got to the point where she didn’t even get peace for wanting to write about her experience with immigrants, despite the fact that leftist eventually became just as bad as leftists, creating a kind of new social hierarchy of victimhood.

For example, in recent months, with the creation of Chaz and Chop in Washington State, they began developing segregation zone between races organized by black people. She wondered then, whether she could even make a joke about Mexican girls being hot in Birkenstocks. Or asian girls for that matter. Feeling constantly on edge, with people other than herself wanting to be the exclusive owners of idealogical dogma, she left the political world with most of her old anxieties unecessessarily aggrivated.

Even now, she refuses to use certain parts of the fediverse, because they still overly used the economy of victimhood, rather than genuine measures of worth and scale. So now all she could was talk about comics, and her old interest in Japanese-manga. But even with this the far-left has found something to complain about.

It’s almost as if it weren’t about persecution.

But rather finding reasons to be a victim.

Yet now here she was, dreaming about the desire to blow an apartment building, because it was populated by ex Free Software developers, with her asking them whether it was OK to speak Japanese, and not French, and when finding out they were Korean-immigrants, lectured about asking whether Japanese and Korean was mutually intelligible.

Nowhere was safe online.

It mattered not the topic.

### Perverted Wonderland

The driveway was cold and wet, as her mother drove her into the school parking lot. She was left to walk into the school on her own, despite the rain. She carried a small umbrella. Her mom went to go park, then met up with her in the main hallway. Together, they toured the school. The university was largely quiet, for some illustration and animation lessons were still in session. One of the doors was open, and she met her eyes with a dark brunette hair colored girl. The school uniform was a yellow business casual tee shirt, skin tight blue jeans, and pair of dark brown Birkenstock clogs.

Her mom said she would see her at the end of year. The home room teacher, a young woman just ten years her senior, wearing what seemed more like an excercise suit one would wear at the beach, rather than what a business professional would wear.

-- Get your portfolio ready.

Eventually she was shown her room after the school day, where she met up again with the girl she had first met in class. -- Are you new here? Our new artist, the main character of this story, simply nodded her head. -- I’m sure that I can force words out of you. She said pushing her lips closer to the new artist. -- But for now I have an itch that needs scratched.

She the new student took off her yellow tee shirt. -- Do you mind scratching my back for me? The new artist was slightly taken aback by this gesture, but was simply glad the hazing rituals was not any more than this. By night time the new artist offered to do a sketch of the girl in the yellow tee shirt. -- Do you promise not to show anyone?

-- Well I haven’t shown anyone my portfolio.

-- Oh wow, so you said something finally.

-- I often don’t have the energy for speech.

It was the next day that the girl in the yellow tee shirt returned the favor, and showed the new artist her portfolio after class. -- So how did showing them your portfolio go for acceptance?

-- Well to tell you the truth, they seemed surprised.

-- Why would that be, your art seems tame.

-- Well ... the school is an all girl’s school, and they’re not exactly what you would call progressive.

It was then that the girl that was her room mate had a smile on her face. -- What is that suppose to mean? Our home room teacher is a giant hippie.

-- Well sometimes look can be decieving.

That night the artist had a dream that she was walking through the school gardens at night, floating in the wind. And she would imagine the statues converging nward on her. Until she realized she was looking at her friend’s portfolio in her dorm, and trying not to touch herself. Because it was in this drawing that her room mate’s sketch was wearing Birkenstock clogs, and it took a knock at a door for her to come back to her senses.

And outside the door, is the teacher.

-- Hey, I saw that image in the portfolio.

-- Sorry my...

-- Don’t worry about, we are good here. But I am curious, where did you get that idea from? It is perverted, and yet something that seems like it would be in a Disney film.

-- It is part of a style I’m refining.

-- What do you call it?

-- Disney’s Perverted Wonderland.

The artist thought that the teacher would try to ask her to live her home room, but instead things went way more smoothly than she expected. Thanks in no small part, do to an element of unethical teacher behaviour. But not something that would normally merit bringing up to the principle. And the rest of the week was a little bit more of a breeze.

She dreamed of haunted gardens.

Gardens of wandering statues.

### The Endless Forest Maze Of Secrets

In some games in the past, graphics were drawn in ASCII text. In this game, the plot varied slightly from the typical plot of the era. In most Roguelikes, you played as an Indianna Jones like character. But in this one, you played as an exposed spy in search of an exit through a midnight forest. But the secret service is on the trial, seeking to hunt you down. Instead of an @ sign, the graphic is a person drawn with a collect of asterix marks in the shape of a stick figure. This would animate in frames.

The character would ride canoes in the river, and hide behind trees. And you had to hide rather than shoot back, in order to avoid the barrage of bullets aiming at your head. The object of the game was to reach the end of the midnight forest path. It had alternate ending based on whether you helped other exposed spies, who would give you various awards and tips. What often went missing in game reviews at the time, was how they spoke a mixture of French and Japanese. Something that people either barely payed attention to, and only met with a laugh. Often excluded is the fact that river flowed in weird direction. You even had speed boosts to avoid more easily hide against those that wanted to shoot you, and you could also moved your canoa in front of stones in the river. Also when you reached the end, you would not met with a congratulations on reaching the end. Rather the game restarted, and you would play it over with a slightly amped up difficult.

With this game with slightly more advanced ASCII text, obviously the goal was to make sure that you will absolutely lose at some point. And when you died death was permanent for that session. But every new playthrough kept the old difficulty in place, as if you never restarted the game at all. As if the world you played it removed every single failure you ever made. This used to freak me out at the time, before I became aware of games called rougelikes, where the developer would choose what things would be removed or kept in cases of permadeath mode. It made things like New Game+ mode a tricky prospect, because you had to make sure the rewards went beyond the standard replayability that came with Roguelikes more generally.

There were rumors of a secret level you could only find by rescuing a random order of exposed agents, which made finding the secret level impossible to write a walkthrough for. But I had found this level by accident, and what I found was that it I got temporarily invincibility when I was aiming my gun, with the exception of environmental damage. I used this in order to shoot at enemies at points that would intended originally to be chase scenes. The only parts where I did not have this ease of difficulty was when the entire Bolivian Army surrounded me in one level. But I was able to keep all the rewards, and somehow managed to be able to unlock the secret level again.

Then it became apparent I figured out how to find the secret level each and every time I reentered the world. Characters that were marked as most needing to be rescued at the moment were marked with a red asterix. I didn’t take note of this in previous sessions, but when I started following that method, I was able to find the secret level every time, and at some point outright prevent some chase scenes from happening.

But I also noticed something strange in these levels. Something others who found the levels never mentioned, presumeably because they were not able to find the level consistently: these level were decorated with a different set of ASCII characters. It was different from the standard ASCII fare. The characters implied that the character was a character character in a game world, within the context of the game world. That they were only a simulation within the continuity of the game, and that the designer had no idea that one would figure out how to find every single clue about to the nature of their existence.

I met a secret NPC, who had dialogue. Bare in mind at this point in time dialogue was unheard of in games in this genre. Here, I found that the NPC always said the same thing: You’re not suppose to be here. This puzzled me at the time, before it became apparent that the layout of the game was different. Also there was a whole other collection of NPCs that one needed to rescue in a specific order. What this almost suggested was I had only unlocked the first stage of an entire secret game few knew about, but had not consistently uncovered before.

I just neededto find the colored dots. If each NPC did not begin to notice my ability to find these dots, and change it around so I had to only rescue ones without dots. Or make everyone have colored dots and I needed to find ones with black dots. It seemed almost as if the game was alive.

And the game was playing me.

My addiction was like puppet strings, stringing me along in a gradually unfolding story.

The story of my own adddiction to secrets.
